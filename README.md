# Flappy-Bird-Game

Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this game is about a bird trying to move through the obstacles in its way. The outline of the game is made using the HTML <canvas> element. This game contains both audio and visual effects and a score system which stores both your current score and your best score. The best score is also stored in the local storage of your system so that you may not lose it if you come back later. It implements some of the most commonly used JavaScript DOM methods such as getElementById(), addEventListener(), getContext() and getBoundingClientRect().
